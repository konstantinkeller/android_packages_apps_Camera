Download the Source
-------------------
To get started with Android/Project Cold Fusion, you'll have to get familiar with [Git and Repo] (http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).

To initialize your local repository using the Project Cold Fusion trees, use the following command:

    repo init -u git://github.com/konstantinkeller/android.git -b mr1-staging

Then to sync up (This will take a while, so you might as well go get some coffee!):

    repo sync

Setup the Build Environment
---------------------------

Download the prebuilts (You HAVE TO CD).

    cd vendor/cm
    . get-prebuilts

Now, setup the build environment (Run this from your working directory root).

    . build/envsetup.sh

Finally, start the build for your device.
